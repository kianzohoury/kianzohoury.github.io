My name is Kian Zohoury, and I am from Los Angeles, CA. Previously, I graduated
from U.C. Berkeley with a B.A. in Computer Science ('22), and worked as a machine
learning engineer (MLE) in the aerospace/defense industry for over a year, where
I gained hands-on industry experience designing, developing, and deploying 
state-of-the-art deep learning models for a variety of real-world applications.

Currently, I am most interested in computer vision and generative AI. I'm 
motivated to solve challenging data science problem that have a real impact on 
the world, and my ultimate goal is to eventually create an AI startup. 
My hobbies include music production, piano, chess, reading, blackjack/poker, 
hiking, cooking italian food & traveling. My favorite quote at the moment is:
