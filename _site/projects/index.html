      <p>Below is a list of recent projects. Corresponding code for each entry can be
accessed through the provided Github link.</p>

<h1 id="conditional-vaes-for-generating-handwritten-digits-mnist">conditional VAEs for generating handwritten digits (MNIST)</h1>
<p>Exploring conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs) for guided image generation 
of handwritten digits, using the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST</a> dataset.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/vae/conditional_vae_latent_crop.gif" alt="Figure" width="100%" /></p>

<p>While VAEs are not entirely new, they are pivotal in understanding how variational
inference allows us to approximate posterior distributions. For this reason,
VAEs are abundantly used (over vanilla autoencoders) in latent diffusion models.
I provide an in-depth comparative analysis of vanilla autoencoders, VAEs, and CVAEs,
observing properties of latent spaces generated by deterministic and probabilistic
encoders. Dimensionality reductions techniques like principal component analysis (PCA)
and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are used for visualizing
d-dimensional latent spaces and visualizing high-dimensional pixel spaces. Kernel
density estimates (KDEs) are also used to visually assess whether latent distributions
appear univariate/bivariate normal.</p>

<h1 id="auralflow-">auralflow üîäüéµ</h1>
<p>PyTorch-based application for training/evaluating source separation models to 
extract stems (e.g. vocals) from audio for music remixing.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/auralflow/auralflow.png" alt="Figure" /></p>

<p>As someone who previously pursue music production for a living, I was constantly
on the search for studio-quality acapellas (vocals only) for song remixing. While
several models existed at the time (e.g. DEMUCS, Open-Unmix), there weren‚Äôt any
modeling toolkits available for customizing such models. To aid my own model 
development and training/evaluation workflows, I conveniently designed a 
package to have the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-trained source separators (end-to-end audio generation)</li>
  <li>dataset classes designed for efficient audio data chunking</li>
  <li>audio-tailored loss functions (e.g. component loss, Si-SDR loss, etc.)</li>
  <li>models wrappers with built-in pre/post audio processing methods
(e.g. STFT, phase approximation, etc.)</li>
  <li>high-level object-orientated model trainer (similar to Lightning)</li>
  <li>visualization tools for audio and spectrogram representations</li>
  <li>GPU-accelerated MIR evaluation (e.g. Si-SDR, Si-SNR, etc.)</li>
  <li>source separation of large audio folders</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/auralflow/temp.png" alt="Figure" width="150%" /></p>

<p>The project is not currently being maintained, but I plan on resuming development
soon.

<h1 id="neural-style-transfer--">neural style transfer üé® üì∑</h1>
<p>PyTorch-based implementations (from scratch) of several distinct deep learning 
approaches (optimization, transformation networks, CycleGAN) that aim to solve 
a popular problem in computer vision called style transfer.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/style_transfer/taj_mahal_van_gogh_fast.gif" alt="Figure" width="150%" /></p>

<p>Put simply, the task in style transfer is to generate an image that preserves 
the content of image x (i.e. semantics, shapes, edges, etc.) while matching 
the style of image y (i.e. textures, patterns, color, etc.). One may ask: 
what is the correct balance between content and style? As it turns out, the 
answer is more subjective than typical optimization/ML problems - ‚Äúbeauty is
in the eye‚Äôs of the beholder‚Äù, as they say.</p>

<h1 id="ecoshopper-Ô∏è-">ecoshopper ‚ôªÔ∏è üõí</h1>
<p>AI-powered recycling assistant.</p>

<p>Ecoshopper was a prototype mobile web application designed as part of a 
final project for the Summer 2021 iteration of UC Berkeley‚Äôs CS 160. The core 
ML design of the app involved a pretrained VGG16 backbone that served as 
a rich feature extractor for transfer learning. Using Stanford‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/garythung/trashnet">TrashNet</a>
dataset along with human annotation, a downstream classifier was trained to identify recylable goods from 
non-recyclable goods.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/assets/img/ecoshopper/eco_shopper.jpg" alt="Figure" /></p>

<p>Model implementation and deployment were done with PyTorch and Django, and 
front-end development was done with React Native.
