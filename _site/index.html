<p>Hi üëãüèº, my name is Kian Zohoury. I am 27 and was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. 
Previously, I graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a B.A. in Computer Science (‚Äò22), 
and worked as a machine learning engineer (MLE) in the aerospace/defense industry 
for over a year. There, I worked on a variety of ML/AI projects involving
designing, developing, and deploying deep learning models for 
real-world problems like quality control in additive manufacturing, 
synthetic data generation for object detectors and textures in 3D physics engines, and 
codon optimization for enhancing protein folding/expression.</p>

<p>Currently, I am most interested in generative AI for tasks in vision and audio. 
I‚Äôm continuously learning and find motivation in successfully applying and implementing 
ideas from research into my own projects. One day, I wish to eventually create 
an AI startup, likely in generative AI for music generation. My hobbies include 
music production, piano, chess, blackjack/poker, hiking, &amp; cooking italian food.
One of my favorite quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThey think that intelligence is about noticing things that are relevant 
(detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring 
things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns).‚Äù</p>

  <p>‚Äî Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Bed of Procrustes</p>
